# Advent of Code: Solving Kotlin
This repository was created to share my solutions for Kotlin puzzles on Advent of Code. My main goal here it's for
study purposes and maybe helping someone else looking for a puzzle solution.

## Running locally
For now there is no dependencies, and you can run the code through the `Main.kt` file using a Kotlin compatible IDEA.

## Project architecture
As soon as I want to store here as many events as I can, I need to organize it per year and day, so I decided to make
it using packages. This is probably not the best way to do this, so when I find another better way, I'll refactor it. So
the pattern is a package named as "at + year" for each year, then inside there will be another package for the day like
"day + number of the day" and finally, inside there will be as many files as I decide to use to solve the problem. Any
file with the suffix "KTS" stands for "Kotlin Team Solution". It means that I'm ok with my solution, but looked into
their to try to learn more.
