# Advent of Code: Solving Kotlin
This repository was created to share my solutions for Kotlin puzzles on Advent of Code. My main goal here it's for
study purposes and maybe helping someone else looking for a puzzle solution.

## Running locally
For now there is no dependencies, and you can run the code through the `Main.kt` file using a Kotlin compatible IDEA.
